      <p>
        This artwork was done in 2024 and was created using a thick A3 paper,
        alcohol-baser markers, fineliners, ink pens and glue pens/markers. The
        paper came from a collection from "Akademibokhandeln". The alcohol based
        markers were from Copic which is an Japanese brand that make
        professional alhohol markers with a one side of the pen being a brush
        which is superduper awesome when you do layers and mix colors. I Also
        used different fineliners and epsecially different glue pens which you
        can see outlining many of the figures.
